## Short Form Code of Conduct
The Stoplight Community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers. 

Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. See our reporting guidelines [here](./incident-reporting.md). Our full Code of Conduct can be found at this [link](#long-form-code-of-conduct). 

## Long Form Code of Conduct
The Stoplight Community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, or religion (or lack thereof). Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form.

This Code of Conduct applies to all Stoplight Community spaces, including the Stoplight Community Forum, Stoplight open source repositories, and Stoplight events and meetups, online and offline, as well as in one-on-one communications about Stoplight Community business. Participants violating our Code of Conduct may be penalized or expelled at the discretion of community moderators.

Some Stoplight Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which are posted publicly for participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. We invite all those who participate in the Stoplight Community to help us create safe and positive community experiences.

Consequences for noncompliance with the Code of Conduct may include a discussion with moderators, mediation with the participant you may have harassed, or as an absolute last resort, a ban from the community.

### Procedures

[Procedures for Incident Reporting](./incident-reporting.md)

### Enforcement
- Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately, even if participants do not agree with or fully acknowledge the behavior being reported.
- If a participant violates the Code of Conduct at an event, community moderators may take any action they deem appropriate to maintaining a welcoming environment for all participants, up to and including expulsion from an event and/or the community and identification of the participant as a violator. If a community moderator is not available at an event, the event organizer should ask violators to leave and then report the situation to community moderators for further deliberation.
- There will always be at least one moderator “on-call” if no moderators can attend an event
Community moderators and/or event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting or making an environment hostile for any participants.

### Moderators
Code of Conduct moderators will:

- Always be at least two people working together to respond to violations.
- Respond as promptly as possible to reports of violations.
- Make an effort to understand both sides of the situation, including talking to affected participants and reading up on the underlying issues, particularly if they don’t have similar personal experience(s).
- Keep each other accountable.
- Trade off duties when needed.
- Recuse themselves or be excused from handling an incident if they are listed as a possible Code of Conduct violator. 
- Be kept up-to-date in the [Stoplight Community Moderators document](./moderators.md).
- Currently, there is only one trained moderator; we acknowledge this is not an ideal reporting situation and we are working to increase the number of trained moderators.

### Additional Items

- Moderators can choose to close threads or ask for a subject change.
- Moderators can choose to re-evaluate consequences.
- This Code of Conduct applies to Stoplight Community spaces and events, but if you are being or have been harassed by a Stoplight Community participant externally, you may still report to the Stoplight Community moderators. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by community participants seriously. The Stoplight Community moderators reserve the right to exclude people from the Stoplight Community and/or Stoplight events based on past and/or external behavior towards Stoplight Community participants or non-participants.
- We will not name harassment victims without their consent. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Stoplight Community or the general public.

### Code of Conduct Feedback
Feedback is always appreciated! You can create an [issue in the Github repository](https://github.com/stoplightio/code-of-conduct/issues) or send private feedback in the form located [here](https://goo.gl/forms/S1F2peu76X548xrj1).

The Stoplight Community Code of Conduct is a living document. It will grow with the Stoplight Community to ensure we are providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants.
